## *Ridge Regression*
good for multicollinearity, grouped selection
not good for variable selection

## *LASSO*
good for variable selection
not good for grouped selection for strongly correlated predictors

## *Elastic Net*
combine strength between Ridge Regression - and LASSO

## *Regularization*
trade bias for variance reduction
better prediction accuracy
